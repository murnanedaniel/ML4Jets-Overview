Such methods are promising for a range of measurements, including at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where no single observable may be optimal to scan over the entire theoretical phase space under consideration, or where binning data into histograms could result in a loss of sensitivity. This work develops an NSBI framework for statistical inference, using neural networks to estimate probability density ratios, which enables the application of NSBI to a full-scale LHC analysis. It incorporates a large number of systematic uncertainties, quantifies the uncertainty coming from finite training statistics, develops a method to construct confidence intervals, and demonstrates a series of intermediate diagnostic checks that can be performed to validate the robustness of the method. As an example, the power and feasibility of the method are demonstrated on simulated data for a simplified version of an off-shell Higgs boson couplings measurement in the four-leptons final states. This NSBI framework is an extension of the standard statistical framework used by LHC experiments and can benefit a large number of physics analyses.'}\n",

      "Abstract: {'summary': \"Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require ``track functions'', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction $r_q$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of $r_q$ distributions in dijet events from the $140$ fb$^{-1}$ of $\\\\sqrt{s}~=~13$ TeV proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS detector. The first six moments of the $r_q$ distribution are extracted and demixed based on theory predictions to present values for quark and gluon jets separately. The data are corrected for detector effects based on machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the $r_q$ distribution provides direct access to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.\"}\n",

      "Abstract: {'summary': 'Simulation of the detector response is a major computational challenge in modern High-Energy Physics experiments, accounting for about 40% of the total computational resources used in ATLAS. The simulation of the calorimeter response is particularly demanding, consuming about 80% of the total simulation time. In order to make the best use of the available computational resources, fast simulation tools based on Machine Learning techniques have been developed to simulate the calorimeter response faster than Geant4 while maintaining a high level of accuracy. One such tool, developed by the ATLAS Collaboration and currently in production for LHC Run 3, is FastCaloGAN, which uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate electromagnetic and hadronic showers. To facilitate the training and optimisation of the GANs, and to enable a more efficient use of computational resources, a container-based system, FastCaloGANtainer, facilitates the deployment of the FastCaloGAN training on complementary high-performance resources such as High Performance Computing (HPC) farms and ensures its operational independence from the underlying system. This talk presents the latest developments in FastCaloGAN and FastCaloGANtainer, discussing their technical details and recent improvements in terms of Physics and computational performance. For FastCaloGAN, these improvements include an improved voxelisation and extension to further use cases (e.g. particle types not yet covered), while for FastCaloGANtainer they concern its deployment on a wider variety of resources with multi-CPU/GPU nodes and different architectures (including cutting-edge HPC clusters such as Leonardo at CINECA in Bologna, Italy).'}\n",

The HL-LHC upgrade of the ATLAS detector brings an unprecedented tracking reconstruction challenge, both in terms of the large number of silicon hit cluster readouts and the throughput required for budget-constrained track reconstruction. Traditional track reconstruction techniques often contain steps that scale combinatorically, which could be ameliorated with deep learning approaches. The GNN4ITk project has been shown to apply geometric deep learning algorithms for tracking to a similar level of physics performance with traditional techniques while scaling sub-quadratically. In this contribution, we compare the computational performance of a variety of pipeline configurations and machine learning inference methods. These include heuristic-and-ML-based graph segmentation techniques, GPU-based module map graph construction, and studies of high throughput graph convolutional kernels. In this contribution, we present benchmarks of latency, throughput, memory usage, and power consumption of each pipeline configuration.'}\n",

For the Run 3 MC campaign, various improvements of AtlFast3 were developed, for example a refinement and extended usage of the GANs and a better model of the punch through of showers into the muon system. Consequently, the performance of AtlFast3 in Run 3 is better than ever. ATLAS also aspires to use fast simulation in the inner detector.

ATLAS analyses are taking the first steps in this direction, following the results obtained from CWoLa (Classification Without Labels) based resonant searches. The poster shows the results obtained with Anomaly Detections approaches in ATLAS, where events are selected solely because of their incompatibility with a learned background-only model. In particular, my focus is on the search for a heavy resonance Y decaying into a Standard Model Higgs boson H and a new particle X in a fully hadronic final state, which represents the first application of fully unsupervised machine learning to an ATLAS analysis.'}\n",

      "Abstract: {'summary': 'Simulation of the detector response is a major computational challenge in modern High Energy Physics experiments, as for example it accounts for about two fifths of the total ATLAS computing resources. Among simulation tasks, calorimeter simulation is the most demanding, taking up about 80% of resource use for simulation and expected to increase in the future. Solutions have been developed to cope with this demand, notably fast simulation tools based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which are faster than Geant4 when simulating calorimeter response and maintain a high level of accuracy. However, these ML-based models require a lot of computing resources to train. Moreover, computational resources can also be saved by deploying their training on other resources than the CERN HTCondor batch system or the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, with the opportunity to have an additional boost in computing performance. In this work we introduce FastCaloGANtainer, a containerized version of FastCaloGAN, a fast simulation tool developed by the ATLAS Collaboration. FastCaloGANtainer allows the training of this tool on more powerful devices such as High Performance Computing clusters and reduces software dependencies on local or distributed file systems (such as CVMFS).

The track overlay approach involves pre-reconstructing pileup tracks and subsequently running reconstruction exclusively on hard-scatter tracks. This allows us to conserve valuable CPU resources by concentrating on events of interest. Integral to track overlay is the incorporation of machine learning (ML)-based decision processes. ML decisions guide the selection of events suitable for track overlay, while events in denser environments continue to use the standard overlay. This strategy ensures judicious use of resources, balancing efficiency and precision in inner detector reconstruction. This presentation focuses on constructing the ML model and verifying the workflow with ML decisions. The improvement of the track overlay approach on CPU usage in the Run 3 detector setup are also demonstrated.'}\n",

      "Abstract: Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require ``track functions'', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction $r_q$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of $r_q$ distributions in dijet events from the $140$ fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s}~=~13$ TeV proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS detector. The first six moments of the $r_q$ distribution are extracted and demixed based on theory predictions to present values for quark and gluon jets separately. The data are corrected for detector effects based on machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the $r_q$ distribution provides direct access to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.\n",

This talk will present recent results from the ATLAS collaboration of the Higgs boson decays to b-quarks analysis with an emphasis on machine learning techniques, crucial to enhance the precision of high pT measurements.\n",

      "Date: 10 Sep 2024\n",
      "Abstract: The identification of top quark decays, known as top tagging, is a crucial component in many measurements and searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Recently machine learning techniques have greatly improved the performance of top tagging algorithms. This poster presents the performance of several machine learning based jet tagging methods. In particular the performance of a Lund jet plane based tagger is compared to existing baselines. Then the systematic uncertainties in network performance are estimated through an approximate procedure that allows the size of the produced uncertainties to be quantified along with the raw performance. The most performant algorithms are found to produce the largest uncertainties, motivating the development of methods to reduce these uncertainties without compromising performance.\n",

      "Date: 10 Sep 2024\n",
      "Abstract: Flavour-tagging is a critical component of the ATLAS experiment physics programme. Existing flavour tagging algorithms rely on several low-level taggers, which are a combination of physically informed algorithms and machine learning models. A novel approach presented here instead uses a single machine learning model based on reconstructed tracks, avoiding the need for low-level taggers based on secondary vertexing algorithms. This new approach reduces complexity and improves tagging performance. This model employs a transformer architecture to process information from a variable number of tracks and other objects in the jet in order to simultaneously predict the jets flavour, the partitioning of tracks into vertices, and the physical origin of each track. The inclusion of auxiliary tasks aids the models interpretability. The new approach significantly improves jet flavour identification performance compared to existing methods in both Monte-Carlo simulation and collision data. Notably, the versatility of the approach is demonstrated by its successful application in boosted Higgs tagging using large-R jets.\n",

      "Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) models with featuring small mass splittings between one or more particles and the lightest neutralino could solve the hierarchy problem as well as offer a suitable dark matter candidate consistent with the observed thermal-relic dark matter density. However, the detection of SUSY higgsinos at the LHC remains challenging especially if their mass-splitting is O(1 GeV) or lower. Searches are developed using 140 fb^{-1} of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS Detector at a center-of-mass energy \\sqrt{s}=13 TeV to overcome the challenge. Novel techniques are developed exploiting machine-learning techniques, low-momentum tracks with large transverse impact parameters, or topologies consistent with VBF production of the supersymmetric particles. Results are interpreted in terms of SUSY simplified models and, for the first time since the LEP era, several gaps in different ranges of mass-splittings are excluded.\n",

A particularly expensive step in this chain is track finding, where energy deposits in the inner tracker (ITk) are grouped into subsets of track candidates, which can then be fitted and provided for downstream tasks. In an effort to reduce execution times and harness accelerator hardware such as GPUs, for both offline and online purposes, machine learning approaches are being developed for track finding. A first functional implementation of a graph neural network-based track pattern reconstruction for ITk has been developed, with competitive physics performance compared with traditional methods.

      "Abstract: $Z$ boson events at the Large Hadron Collider can be selected with high purity and are sensitive to a diverse range of QCD phenomena. As a result, these events are often used to probe the nature of the strong force, improve Monte Carlo event generators, and search for deviations from Standard Model predictions. All previous measurements of $Z$ boson production characterize the event properties using a small number of observables and present the results as differential cross sections in predetermined bins. In this analysis, a machine learning method called OmniFold is used to produce a simultaneous measurement of twenty-four $Z$+jets observables using $139$ fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. Unlike any previous fiducial differential cross-section measurement, this result is presented unbinned as a dataset of particle-level events, allowing for flexible re-use in a variety of contexts and for new observables to be constructed from the twenty-four measured observables.\n",

The simulation of the calorimeter response is particularly demanding, consuming about 80% of the total simulation time. In order to make the best use of the available computational resources, fast simulation tools based on Machine Learning techniques have been developed to simulate the calorimeter response faster than Geant4 while maintaining a high level of accuracy. One such tool, developed by the ATLAS Collaboration and currently in production for LHC Run 3, is FastCaloGAN, which uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate electromagnetic and hadronic showers. To facilitate the training and optimisation of the GANs, and to enable a more efficient use of computational resources, a container-based system, FastCaloGANtainer, facilitates the deployment of the FastCaloGAN training on complementary high-performance resources such as High Performance Computing (HPC) farms and ensures its operational independence from the underlying system. This talk presents the latest developments in FastCaloGAN and FastCaloGANtainer, discussing their technical details and recent improvements in terms of Physics and computational performance. For FastCaloGAN, these improvements include an improved voxelisation and extension to further use cases (e.g. particle types not yet covered), while for FastCaloGANtainer they concern its deployment on a wider variety of resources with multi-CPU/GPU nodes and different architectures (including cutting-edge HPC clusters such as Leonardo at CINECA in Bologna, Italy).'}\n",

Included are results from the evolved standard trigger track reconstruction, and from new unconventional tracking strategies used for the first time in the Run 3 trigger. The application of ID tracking in the Run 3 trigger is significantly expanded, in particular full-detector tracking is utilized for hadronic signatures such as jets and missing transverse energy triggers, for the first time. To meet computing resource limitations, new features have been developed. These include machine-learning additions for the track seeding, together with many additional improvements with respect to the trigger tracking used in LHC Run 2. As the world's highest-energy particle accelerator, the LHC provides a unique opportunity for directly searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Massive long-lived particles (LLPs), which are absent in the Standard Model are present in many well-motivated theories of beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. These new massive LLPs can decay into other particles far from the LHC interaction region, resulting in novel experimental signatures and so require new complex techniques for their identification. Prior to Run 3, the ATLAS trigger did not include dedicated tracking triggers for the explicit identification of massive LLPs decaying in the inner tracking detectors. To enhance the sensitivity of such searches, a series of new triggers were developed for the Run 3 data taking in 2022. These included various novel unconventional tracking signatures, such as those for displaced tracks, displaced jets, or short tracks which disappear within the ID tracking volume. With these developments, the high performance of the ID trigger remains essential for the ATLAS physics programme in Run 3, both for precision measurements of the Standard Model and now also searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model.\"}\n",

Among the measurements performed, especially interesting is the measurement of the Higgs boson decays to two $b$-quarks. However, this decay mode is hard to observe because of the large background from multi-jet production. To measure the Higgs boson decaying to two $b$-quarks, the best Higgs boson production channel is the associated production with a vector boson (VH) where one vector boson, either the W or Z boson, is produced in association with a Higgs boson. If the vector boson decays leptonically into neutrinos or changed leptons, the leptons will provide a handle to reduce the large multi-jet background. This thesis work involves multiple efforts on increasing the signal significance of the VH, H$\\\\rightarrow$bb analysis including optimizing the event selection, adding a new control region for the top background and using machine learning methods to purify the W+jets background in a dedicated control region and ultimately to get a better constraint on the normalization factor for this background.

Tau leptons are also vital in the search for beyond the standard model physics, as many models predict new particles which decay into final states with tau leptons. An efficient tau lepton trigger is therefore essential to maximize the physics reach of the CMS experiment. The latest online reconstruction algorithms used to trigger on tau leptons with the CMS detector that utilize machine learning based methods for the first time are described here.

      "Date: No date\n",
      "Abstract: {'summary': 'The LHCb experiment is dedicated to precision measurements of hadrons containing $b$ and $c$ quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. During the first two Runs of the LHC, spanning from 2010 to 2018, the LHCb Collaboration invested more than 90% of the computing budget to simulate the detector response to the traversing particles produced in heavy hadron decays. Since 2022, the LHCb experiment has relied on a renewed detector and a novel data-acquisition strategy designed to acquire data at a rate enhanced by a factor of ten. Enabling an equivalent increase in simulation production is a major challenge, requiring a technological shift and diversifying the simulation strategies for specific purposes. Data processing and data analysis technologies have been evolving quickly during the last ten years. New industrial standards and huge communities behind open-source software projects arose, transforming the landscape of computer science and data processing. The fast development of Machine Learning and Cloud technologies provides modern solutions to address challenges well known to the High Energy Physics community, operating distributed data processing software on the nodes of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid for the last three decades. In this Thesis, I present a study to adopt these new technologies to evolve the LHCb simulation software using machine learning models trained on multi-cloud resources to parameterize the detector response and the effects induced by the reconstruction algorithms. The resulting detector simulation approach is known as flash-simulation and represents the most challenging and radical option in the landscape of opportunities to accelerate the detector simulation. To encode in a machine learning model the intrinsic randomness of the quantum interactions occurring within the detector, the experimental uncertainties, and the effect of missing variables, parameterizations are designed as Generative Models, and in particular as Generative Adversarial Networks. The Lamarr project, arising as the official flash-simulation option of the LHCb experiment, enables connecting the trained models in long data-processing pipelines to simulate various effects in the detection and reconstruction procedure. Pipelines can be deployed in the LHCb Simulation software stack by relying on the same physics generators as the other simulation approaches and serializing the results with the format of the official reconstruction software. In this Thesis, I address the most compelling challenges in the design of a flash-simulation solution, including the identification of a strategy to train and validate reliable parameterizations, the definition and distribution of heavy hyperparameter optimization campaigns through opportunistic computing resources, the combination of multiple parameterizations in a data processing pipeline, and its deployment in the software stack of one of the major experiments at the LHC. Future work will extend the validation of flash-simulation techniques for additional heavy hadrons, decay modes, and data-taking conditions, paving the way to the widespread adoption of flash-simulations and contributing to a significant decrease in the average computational cost of detector simulation.'}\n",

      "Date: No date\n",
      "Abstract: {'summary': 'Studies related to heavy-ion collisions at the most powerful particle accelerators in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland, and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL, USA, have primarily focused on the creation and properties of the primordial matter consisting quarks and gluons. This extremely dense and hot state of thermalized partons is also known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the shorter lifetime of QGP, experiments rely on several indirect signatures that hint towards the formation of QGP in ultra-relativistic collisions of nuclear matter. While the formation of QGP has been established for a long time in heavy-ion collisions, its presence in small collision systems still needs to be determined. However, recent measurements of heavy-ion-like behavior in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC have drawn the attention of the heavy-ion physics community. The appearance of ridge-like structures and the enhancement of strangeness add to these speculations. Increased production of strange hadrons can only be explained via forming a strongly interacting medium at thermal and chemical equilibrium. To determine whether the underlying physics processes involved in the strangeness production can also be probed with topological event selection instead of the average charged-particle multiplicity, a relatively new event shape classifier has been introduced at the LHC, known as the transverse spherocity ($S_0$). This event-shape observable can decouple the jet-dominated events from the events with spherical soft emission of particles. The first event is called the jetty type, and the latter is called the isotropic type. Jetty events result from enhanced contributions of perturbative QCD processes; however, isotropic events arise due to the interplay of several soft QCD processes, such as the multi-parton interactions and the initial and final state radiations. It is found that the production rates of strange particles are slightly higher for soft isotropic events and highly suppressed in hard jetty events. This supports the hypothesis that in high-multiplicity pp collisions, heavy-ion-like effects such as strangeness enhancement and radial flow are manifested in the isotropic events. Thus, transverse spherocity can separate events based on azimuthal topology and control heavy-ion-like effects in high-multiplicity pp collisions. A similar study of strange hadron production with topological event selection can also be performed for the case of charm hadrons. In the presence of QGP, the yield of charmonium ($c\\\\bar{c}$) is suppressed compared to the yield in the non-QGP scenarios in hadronic collisions. Therefore, studies involving charm hadrons with different topological event selections can help us understand its production mechanism and constrain various phenomenological models. Additionally, it can help us understand the observed heavy-ion-like effects in isotropic events in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC. With these motivations, this analysis measures the $p_{\\\\rm T}$-differential yield of inclusive $J/\\\\psi$ as a function of transverse spherocity in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV with ALICE. For this analysis, the reconstruction of $J/\\\\psi$ is performed through the electromagnetic decay channel, $J/\\\\psi \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu^{+}\\\\mu^{-}$ , B.R.~=~($5.961 \\\\pm 0.033)\\\\%$ in forward rapidity, $2.5<y<4.0$, using the forward muon spectrometer. For the estimation of transverse spherocity, midrapidity tracklets $(|\\\\eta|<0.8)$ are reconstructed using the Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD), which is the innermost central barrel detector in ALICE. The V0 scintillator detectors with a pseudorapidity coverage of $2.8<\\\\eta<5.1$ (V0A) and $-3.7<\\\\eta<-1.7$ (V0C) have been used for the estimation of event multiplicity. Such event shape-based analysis can also be implemented in heavy-ion collisions for different purposes. The appearance of strong transverse collectivity in non-central heavy-ion collisions is considered to be another signature of QGP. In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the initial spatial anisotropy gets converted into the final state momentum anisotropy during the medium evolution process and is reflected in the azimuthal momentum distribution of the charged particles. This is quantified as the anisotropic flow coefficients. To study the effect of topological event selection on the anisotropic flow coefficients, we implement transverse spherocity-based event shape analysis in heavy-ion collisions. Using transverse spherocity as an event shape tool, this study will complement the current event shape approach based on flow vectors in heavy-ion collisions. We report an extensive study of transverse spherocity dependence of elliptic flow of charged particles in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm NN}} = 5.02$~TeV using a multiphase transport model (AMPT). The elliptic flow for identified light-flavor hadrons and their number-of-constituent-quark scaling are also investigated in different event classes using transverse spherocity at RHIC and LHC energies. This study implements the two-particle correlation method to extract the transverse momentum differential elliptic flow coefficients. The two-particle correlation method helps in removing substantial nonflow from the calculation using a relative pseudorapidity cut between the particle pairs. Over the years, special attention has been given to the theoretical understanding of elliptic flow by modeling the medium evolution through relativistic hydrodynamics and various transport models. From the experimental side, the standard event plane method or the complex reaction plane identification method, the multi-particle correlation, and the cumulant method are usually followed to estimate elliptic flow. For the first time, we implement a feed-forward deep neural network to estimate the elliptic flow coefficient from the final state particle kinematics in heavy-ion collisions. The flow coefficients are embedded in the final state multi-particle correlations; hence, a deep neural network can be trained on simulated data to learn these correlations and efficiently measure the flow coefficients. The machine learning (ML) model is trained on simulated minimum bias Pb--Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm NN}} = 5.02$~TeV using the AMPT string melting model. After successful training, the same ML model is applied across several collision systems at RHIC and LHC energies. Since elliptic flow has several dependencies, such as centrality, transverse momentum, particle species (or mass), and collision energy, it is interesting to explore the prediction capability of the ML model in these sectors. The model predictions for the elliptic flow of light-flavor hadrons and the number-of-constituent-quark scaling depicting the partonic level collectivity are also covered. These results from the ML model are compared to experimental findings, wherever possible.'}\n",

      "Abstract: {'summary': 'Jet production is a fundamental probe of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD).  They play a vital role also in other areas of high energy physics.  Jet quenching is arguably one of the most spectacular proofs of the creation of quark-gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions. Nowadays, the rise of novel experimental techniques, including jet substructure observables and the application of machine learning algorithms,   are revolutionizing this field of study. New jet tagging capabilities allow for comparative studies between jet flavours.  Substructure measurements open doors for direct observation of the effects, entangled into more generic observables.  A perfect example is the dead-cone measurement by ALICE. Results shown in this thesis benefit from both of these advances. The first part describes the analysis of the beauty-jet production cross section,  measured in pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeVby the ALICE experiment at the LHC.  It is the first application of machine learning for heavy-flavour jet measurements in ALICE. The new method significantly improves tagging efficiency and purity, and shows a good stability over a wide range of these parameters. Results are consistent with the NLO pQCD predictions and the ALICE results obtained with other methods. The second part shows simulation studies for the dead-cone effect  measurement for beauty jets in heavy-ion collisions. The study focuses on the removal of distortions introduced by uncorrelated heavy-ion background.  The combination of jet reclustering and jet grooming allows for the restoration of the quantitative properties related to the dead-cone effect of jets.  Additionally, this thesis highlights some potential issues that may arise during future measurements of this effect, which are not immediately apparent.'}\n",

      "Abstract: {'summary': 'The Quark$-$Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a new matter state composited by deconfined quarks and gluons which exist at extremely high temperature and energy density. This formation of matter, predicted by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the Standard Model, shows great importance as a phenomenon to test QCD theories with its phase transitions, where the properties of matter can be investigated in ultra$-$relativistic heavy$-$ion collision experiments. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the produced experiments data of heavy ion collisions create possibility for QGP researches, with phenomena such as jet quenching, where high transverse momentum partons undergo energy loss interacting with de$-$confined medium via elastic processes or induced gluon radiations, and collective motions, where the expansion of bulk matter exhibits different patterns such as isotropic and anisotropic components which are physically driven by pressure gradients. Heavy quarks, are powerful probes of QGP due to their shorter formation timescale, and they are to mostly go through the full evolution of the collision system in space$-$time. $\\\\\\\\$  In this thesis, the measurements of non$-$prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ production in pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}=5.02~\\\\mathrm{TeV}$ and in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{{s_\\\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02~\\\\mathrm{TeV}$ with ALICE detectors are reported. The measurements of non$-$prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$, which are produced in beauty$-$hadron decays, can provide valuable information in beauty sector. The measurement of production in pp collisions is important to test perturbative QCD calculations, and provide a reference for Pb$-$Pb collisions. While in latter, the non$-$prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ measurement can help to study the microscopic beauty$-$medium interactions. At high $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$, it allows to investigate the colour charge and mass dependence of in$-$medium energy loss. At low $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$, the participation of system collective expansion and diffusion process for beauty quarks can be investigated. $\\\\\\\\$  In pp collisions, the $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$$-$differential production cross section of non$-$prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ is measured at midrapidity ($|y|<0.5$). The $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ meson candidates are reconstructed via the hadronic decay channel $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathrm{K^{-}\\\\pi^{+}}$. Then specific selections based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), a machine learning model trained with pseudo$-$data from Monte Carlo simulations and background sample in data, are applied to the candidates. The application of BDT reduces the combinatorial background, and also to enhance the non--prompt fraction of $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ from around 30$\\\\%$ to 90$\\\\%$ in signals. Afterwards, the signals are extracted via the invariant$-$mass analysis, and the non$-$prompt fractions are estimated with a data$-$driven minimizing$-$$\\\\chi^2$ approach. The measured $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$$-$differential cross section is within the transverse momentum range $1 \\\\lt p_{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\lt 24~\\\\mathrm{GeV}/c$. With an extrapolating method, the $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$$-$integrated cross section is estimated at high precision.  The results are well described by perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations. The results are in good agreement with central prediction with FONLL calculated beauty hadron cross section and PYTHIA8 decay kinematics, while another prediction with GM$-$VFNS with two different transition approaches from beauty to non$-$prompt meson underestimated the measurement. Moreover, the total $\\\\mathrm{b\\\\bar{b}}$ production cross section is also determined from the measurements together with non$-$prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$, $\\\\mathrm{D}^{+}$, and $\\\\mathrm{D^+_s}$ mesons, which is compatible with previous measurements of di--electron production at the same centre$-$of$-$mass energy as well as the cross section predicted by pQCD calculations such as FONLL and NNLO. The measured production in pp collisions also provide a reference for the same measurement in heavy$-$ion collisions. $\\\\\\\\$  While in Pb$-$Pb collisions, a similar measurement is performed at same per$-$nucleon$-$pair centre$-$of$-$mass energy. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\\\mathrm{AA}}$) of non$-$prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ was measured for the first time down to $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}=1~\\\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ in $0-10\\\\%$ and $30-50\\\\%$ centrality classes. A suppression in $R_{\\\\mathrm{AA}}$ of factor about 3 (2) is observed for $p_\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\gt5~\\\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ in $0-10\\\\%$ ($30-50\\\\%$) centrality, while at lower $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$, $R_{\\\\mathrm{AA}}$ increases with decreasing $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$, and compatible with unity in $1 \\\\lt p_{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\lt 3~\\\\mathrm{GeV}/c$. The data are described by models that include both collisional and radiative processes in calculating beauty$-$quark energy loss in QGP, and quark recombination in addition to fragmentation as hadronization mechanism. The $R_{\\\\mathrm{AA}}$ ratios of non$-$prompt to prompt $\\\\mathrm{D}^{0}$$-$meson are reported significantly larger than unity at intermediate $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$ in $0-10\\\\%$ centrality, as predicted by transportation models in which the energy loss for beauty quarks are less than charm quarks due to their larger mass. $\\\\\\\\$'}\n",
